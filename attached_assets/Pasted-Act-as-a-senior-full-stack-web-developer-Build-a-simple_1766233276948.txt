Act as a senior full-stack web developer.
Build a simple, secure, cloud-hosted Crime Tracking Web Application.
The system must avoid all third-party services that require API keys and must not be over-engineered.

1. Project Goal

Develop a basic but functional crime tracking system that allows crime reporting and case management in the cloud.
This is a lightweight academic / demo-ready system, not an enterprise platform.

2. Technology Stack (Strict – No API Keys)
Frontend

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React if needed, but keep it simple)

Tailwind CSS for styling

Fetch API or Axios for requests

Hosted on Netlify or Vercel

Backend

Node.js + Express

REST API

Hosted on Render

Database

MongoDB Atlas (free tier)

Mongoose ODM

MongoDB Atlas uses a connection string, not an API key

3. What the System MUST NOT Use

🚫 No maps
🚫 No Google services
🚫 No Firebase
🚫 No Cloudinary
🚫 No email services
🚫 No payment systems
🚫 No AI
🚫 No third-party APIs requiring keys

4. Authentication (Simple & Local)

Basic email + password login

Password hashing with bcrypt

JWT authentication using a locally generated secret

Roles handled inside the database

5. User Roles (Minimal)
1. Reporter

Submit crime reports

View submitted reports

Track report status

2. Admin

Login

View all reports

Update report status

Delete fake or invalid reports

6. Core Features (Only Essentials)
Crime Reporting

Crime title

Description

Category

Date reported

Auto-generated report ID

Status (Pending / Reviewed / Closed)

Case Management

List of reports

Status update

Simple filters (by status or category)

Dashboard

Total reports

Reports by status

Recent reports list

📌 No maps and no location visualization

7. Database Schema (Simple)
User

name

email

password

role

createdAt

CrimeReport

reportId

title

description

category

status

createdAt

8. API Endpoints

POST /auth/login

POST /auth/register

POST /reports

GET /reports

GET /reports/:id

PUT /reports/:id/status

DELETE /reports/:id

All routes must be protected based on user role.

9. Backend Folder Structure
src/
 ├─ routes/
 ├─ controllers/
 ├─ models/
 ├─ middleware/
 ├─ config/
 └─ server.js

10. Deployment Requirements

Environment variables for database connection and JWT secret

Backend deployed on Render

Frontend deployed on Netlify or Vercel

Clear setup instructions

11. Expected Output

The AI must provide:

Full backend code

Frontend pages

MongoDB models

Authentication logic

Deployment steps

README file

Build the system clean, simple, and understandable.
Avoid unnecessary complexity.
No external API keys of any kind.
